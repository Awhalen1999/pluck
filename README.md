# Pluck 🌼

Pluck is a small macOS design tool I built to keep design inspiration visible while you work.

It’s a notch-style app that lives on the side of your screen and stays out of the way until you need it.

## Why I made this

When I’m designing, I’m constantly switching between my editor, browser tabs, and random screenshots to reference a design.

It breaks focus fast and is annoying to be constantly looking around for what I need.

Pluck is meant to solve that by letting you keep inspiration on screen instead of hidden behind tabs.

## How it works

Pluck stays collapsed on the side of your screen and can be dragged anywhere you want.  

You can open and close the notch when you need it, toggle hide it from the menu so it’s not visible at all, and move it to either side of the screen.

Open it up and just drop things in.

Screenshots, images, stuff from your downloads, stuff from the web, things you copy and paste — if it’s an image, you can throw it in there. No import steps, no setup.

Everything is stored locally and organized into folders you control.

When you open an image, you can keep it floating on top of your browser or other apps, so it stays visible while you work.

It’s meant to feel like a small shelf for your designs that’s always within reach.

## What you can do

- Drag & drop images and screenshots  
- Copy and paste images in 
- Organize inspiration into folders  
- Keep design references floating on top of other apps  
- Use it as a lightweight, always-accessible design shelf

## Running it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awhalen1999/pluck.git
```

Open the project in Xcode, hit Run (⌘R), and the app will launch as a native macOS app.

## Notes

This is an open-source project and still a work in progress.
Built mainly to scratch my own itch, but feel free to explore it.
