# Pluck 🌼

Pluck is a small macOS design tool I built to keep design inspiration visible while you work.

It’s a notch-style app that lives on the side of your screen and stays out of the way until you need it.

## Why I made this

When I’m designing, I’m constantly switching between my editor, browser tabs, and random screenshots to reference a design.

It breaks focus fast and is annoying to be constantly looking around for what I need.

Pluck is meant to solve that by letting you keep inspiration on screen instead of hidden behind tabs.

## How it works

Pluck stays collapsed on the side of your screen.  
Click it to open a panel with your folders and saved images.

You can drag in screenshots, paste images, and organize everything however you want.

When you open an image, you can keep it floating on top of your browser or other apps, so it stays visible while you work.

That way you’re not constantly switching tabs just to check a design.

## What you can do

- Drag & drop images and screenshots  
- Copy and paste images in and out  
- Organize inspiration into folders  
- Keep design references floating on top of other apps  
- Use it as a lightweight, always-accessible design shelf

## Running it locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Awhalen1999/pluck.git
```

Open the project in Xcode, hit Run, and the app will launch as a native macOS app.

Notes

This is an open-source project and still a work in progress.
Built mainly to scratch my own itch, but feel free to explore it.
